backbone.js-require.js-compass-sass-boilerplate
===============================================

Boilerplate template for Backbone.js, Require.js, Compass &amp; SASS on front-end development. By combining these frameworks it creates a workflow similar to ActionScript or other OOP languages

<h1>Why use this workflow?</h1>

Development in JavaScript, HTML & CSS has been severly limited in it's ability function in a object oriented workflow and project structure. We constantly have to program the same things over and over on many projects, my goal with this template is to help eliminate some of these repetitive tasks. This is not as important for every front-end development but if you ever hope to re-use your code and abstract features you have created, you need a proper way to work.

Unfortunately there is not one single entity (such as Adobe, Apple or Microsoft) that can give us a collection of tools and language API to write Object Oriented code. We have to piece it together several libraries ourselves, and everyone has their own way of doing this. I know it can get very confusing so I will try to keep this short and to the point.


Instruction for getting started.

1. Install Compass (requires Ruby)
In Terminal (OSX) or Command-Prompt (Windows) enter the following commands:
    gem install compass
    -check if compass is running
    compass version

2. Download Backbone.js
