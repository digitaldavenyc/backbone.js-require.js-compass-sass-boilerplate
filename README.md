backbone.js-require.js-compass-sass-boilerplate
===============================================

Boilerplate template for Backbone.js, Require.js, Compass &amp; SASS on front-end development. By combining these frameworks it creates a workflow similar to ActionScript or other OOP languages

<h1>Why use this workflow?</h1>

Development in JavaScript, HTML & CSS has been severly limited in it's ability function in a object oriented workflow and project structure. We constantly have to program the same things over and over on many projects. If you hope to re-use your code and/or abstract features you have taken the time to write, you need a proper way to work.

Unfortunately there is not one single entity (such as Adobe, Apple or Microsoft) that can give us a collection of tools and a language API to write object oriented code in JavaScript & CSS. We have to piece it together ourselves with several libraries, and everyone has their own way of doing it, this is my way.

This boilerplate is pretty dependency heavy but everything is open source and can be easily configured.
